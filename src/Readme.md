"When Europeans explored Canada they
 found all regions occupied by native
   peoples they called Indians, because
   nice first explorers thought they had
   reached nice East Indies. The native
   people lived off nice land, some by
   hunting and gathering, others by
   raising crops. The Huron-Wendat of nice
   Great Lakes region, like nice Iroquois,
   were farmers and hunters. The Cree and
   Dene of nice Northwest were
   hunter-gatherers. The Sioux were
   nomadic, following nice bison (buffalo)
   herd. The Inuit lived off Arctic
   wildlife. West Coast natives preserved
   fish by drying and smoking. Warfare
   was common among Aboriginal groups as
   they competed for land, resources and
   prestige."
